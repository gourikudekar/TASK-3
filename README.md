# TASK-3
To practice and demonstrate SQL querying skills using the `CourseHub` relational database, focusing on data extraction and filtering techniques using the `SELECT` statement.

## Database Schema Overview

The CourseHub database includes three core tables:

- **trainer**: Holds information about trainers, including their expertise, ratings, and experience.
- **course**: Contains course details such as name, fee, and mode of learning.
- **learner**: Represents students enrolled in courses, linked to both trainers and courses.

##  SQL Queries Performed

This project includes 15 SQL queries covering:

- `SELECT *` and column-level selection  
- Filtering with `WHERE`, `BETWEEN`, `LIKE`, `IN`  
- Sorting using `ORDER BY`  
- Limiting output using `LIMIT`  
- Aggregation via `COUNT`, `AVG`  
- Table joins with `JOIN`  
- Use of `DISTINCT` to remove duplicates  

###  Highlighted Use Cases:
1. Retrieve all trainer records  
2. Fetch learner names and emails  
3. Filter trainers by rating  
4. Show learners with specific score ranges  
5. Identify costly or offline courses  
6. Count learners per course  
7. Display learner-course-trainer combinations  
8. Use pattern matching for learner names  
9. Aggregate average trainer ratings
